# Horiseon-challenge1

## Description
The webpage I refactored code for is used for businesses that need help marketing themselves online. On the webpage a buisness will use the navigation bottons on the top to direct them to where they need information further down on the webpage.
To do this I used VS code to clean up/refactore the HTML and CSS code.
